# Purpose

This package contains functions that are of moderate use. Thus they are not used frequently enough to be remembered but often enough that I need to use them. It is also a way to make my reports more reproducible by versioning and sharing these functions whenever they are used.

# Origins

Most of the code here is obtained either from other packages such as Hmisc and rms or from internet. However this code has been modified from the original.
